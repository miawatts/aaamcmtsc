## About the AAAMC 

The Archives of African American Music and Culture (AAAMC) was established in 1991 by esteemed ethnomusicologist and former Indiana University faculty member, Dr. Portia Maultsby. The AAAMC is an archival repository of materials that covers a range of African American musical idioms and cultural expressions from the post-World War II era. 

The AAAMC supports the research of scholars, students, and general public by providing access to various holdings which include oral histories, musical and print manuscripts, photographs, audio and video recordings, and the personal papers of individuals and organizations pertaining to Black music.
