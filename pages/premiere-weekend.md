## The Premiere Weekend 

One of the primary goals of the AAAMC is to find ways to engage the academy, industry, and the community. An event such as this one was an excellent way to get the public involved in archives and making collections more accessible. The full weekend, entitled Imagine: Collaboration, held two events. The first was a jam session at the Fourth and Rogers (FAR) Center, the second being the world premiere of the Spiritual Collage with the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater.

The jam session at the FAR Center was a free event open to the public. It began with all seven of the featured guest artists playing several tunes for the audience. At the midway point, the audience was invited to ask the artists about their careers and professional advice. The final part of the evening was a jam session, open to members of the audience, to come play with each other and the guest artists. Many of the performers were high school students from the surrounding area who had the opportunity to play with and learn from these jazz legends.

The final evening of the Imagine: Collaboration event was the actual premiere of the work by the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra. Cyrus Chestnut was unable to play in the concert for medical reasons, and so one of the AAAMC Graduate Assistants, Jamaal Baptiste, stepped up to the plate to fill in as the pianist. The evening began with Okoye’s “Voices Shouting Out” followed by Sibelius’ “Violin Concerto in D minor, Op 47” performed by the BSO Youth Concert Winner, Elson Koh. As an introduction for the guest artists, they performed a piece composed by the drummer, Ronnie Burrage. Spiritual Collage was then performed incredibly the orchestra and by the guest soloists. The piece was received with a standing ovation. As a surprise, Mickey Tucker and his wife Sheila were projected to the audience via Zoom from Australia so that they would experience the piece in real time. A proclamation was read by the deputy Mayor of Bloomington decreeing October 23rd officially Mickey Tucker Day in the city of Bloomington.
