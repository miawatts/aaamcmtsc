## Mickey Tucker

Michael "Mickey" B. Tucker is an American jazz pianist, organist and composer. He was born on April 28, 1941 in Durham, North Carolina.
He began piano lessons at age six and by age thirteen, was an accompanist at the Mt. Olive Baptist Church in Durham. At age fifteen, after completing only two years
at Hillside High School in Durham, he was recommended for and awarded an early admission scholarship to Morehouse College in Atlanta. In the 1960s, Tucker 
toured and performed with Little Anthony and the Imperials and Damita Jo. By 1969 he had entered the jazz world and recorded with acclaimed jazz artists such as James Moody, Frank Foster,
Eric Kloss, Louis Hayes, and served as the music director for Art Blakely and the Jazz Messengers. In 1975, he won Downbeat's magazine's Critics Poll as the "artist most deserving wider recognition." 

In the late 1970s and 1980s, he was touring and recording with jazz greats such as George Benson, Archie Shepp, Billy Harper, Archie Shepp, and Richie Cole. During this period, Tucker also performed with classical
music ensembles such as the New Jersey Chamber Music Society and the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra. In addition to composing and recording jazz works, he also spent time composing chamber and large symphonic works. Tucker's 
talent and artistry has been experienced by diversed audiences throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and Southeast Asia for almost three decades. His creativity as a composer traverses varied cultural and artistic boundaries
as his work encompasses solo piano, duets, trios, quintets, sextets, big bands, and symphonies spanning from early jazz inspiration to avant garde, R&B and classical music. 

He emigrated to Sunbury, Australia with his wife, Sheila, where he continued to work as a concert performer, recording artist, and professor at the Victorian College of the Arts. He is an active 
member in the community, although an accident in 1991 impaired his mobility as well as his ability to play the piano.
