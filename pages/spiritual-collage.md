## Spiritual Collage 

Mickey Tucker donated his collection to the AAAMC in 2021. His collection consists of photographs, correspondence, travel documents, audio visual recordings, music manuscripts, and scores. Among the donated material was the score for Spiritual Collage: A Suite in Three Movements for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra. It was unbeknownst to the archivists the significance of the work upon its unboxing. AAAMC director, Dr. Tyron Cooper, spoke to Tucker and realized that Spiritual Collage was what he considered his “magnum opus.” Tucker had recorded the first movement, “Portrait of a Peaceful Scene” as a solo piano work for his 1978 album Sweet Lotus Lips. He also made a home recording of the second movement “Acquaintance” as a solo piano work. However, it had never been performed in its entirety. Not once. 

Mickey Tucker was awarded a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts in 1977 to compose a symphonic work but did not receive enough funds to hire an orchestra, perform the piece, and have it recorded. “I don’t think I will ever hear this piece performed in my lifetime,” the now 81-year-old composer lamented. In an effort to not only engage archival collections in an innovative way, but to make an old man’s dream come true, Dr. Cooper made it his mission to have the work performed and premiered for Tucker.

Spiritual Collage is an ambitious work and was originally composed for a seventy-piece orchestra. It combines Western European classical traditions with a range of African American musical expressions like the Negro spiritual, ragtime, blues, and jazz. 

The Archives of African American Music and Culture in collaboration with the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Alejandro Gomez Guillen, premiered the work on October 23, 2022, which now also happens to be recognized as Mickey Tucker Day in the city of Bloomington.
